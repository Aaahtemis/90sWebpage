                <td><p>The Sun is a medium-sized yellow dwarf star composed primarily of hydrogen (about 73%) and helium (about 25%), with trace amounts of heavier elements. It has a diameter of approximately 1.39 million kilometers, making it about 109 times wider than Earth. Despite being classified as a "dwarf" star, the Sun contains 99.86% of the total mass in our solar system and could fit about 1.3 million Earths inside it. Its surface temperature reaches around 5,778 Kelvin (5,505Â°C), while its core blazes at an incredible 15 million degrees Celsius.</p></td>
                <td><p>At the Sun's core, nuclear fusion occurs through a process called the proton-proton chain reaction. Every second, the Sun converts about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy in the form of photons. This energy takes anywhere from 10,000 to 170,000 years to travel from the core to the surface due to the dense plasma it must pass through. The fusion process is so efficient that the Sun loses about 4 million tons of mass every second, yet it has enough fuel to continue burning for approximately another 5 billion years.</p></td>
                <td><p>The Sun consists of several distinct layers: the core, radiative zone, convection zone, photosphere (visible surface), chromosphere, and corona. The photosphere, which we see as the Sun's surface, is actually a relatively thin layer only about 500 kilometers thick. Above this lies the corona, the Sun's outer atmosphere, which paradoxically reaches temperatures of over a million degrees despite being farther from the core. Solar activity includes sunspots, solar flares, and coronal mass ejections, all driven by the Sun's powerful magnetic field that follows an 11-year cycle of intensity.</p></td>

                <td><p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of only 4,879 kilometers - just 38% the size of Earth. Despite its small size, Mercury is surprisingly dense, with a large iron core that makes up about 75% of the planet's radius. This enormous core is surrounded by a thin silicate mantle and crust, giving Mercury a bulk density second only to Earth. The planet's surface is heavily cratered and resembles our Moon, with ancient impact basins like the Caloris Basin stretching over 1,500 kilometers across. Mercury has virtually no atmosphere, just a thin exosphere composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium blown off its surface by solar wind.</p></td>
                <td><p>Mercury experiences the most extreme temperature swings of any planet in our solar system. During its long days (equivalent to 176 Earth days), surface temperatures on the sunlit side can reach a scorching 427°C (800°F) - hot enough to melt lead. However, without a substantial atmosphere to retain heat, nighttime temperatures plummet to -173°C (-280°F). Paradoxically, scientists have discovered water ice in permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's poles, where temperatures remain constantly below -160°C. These polar regions never see sunlight due to Mercury's minimal axial tilt of just 2 degrees.</p></td>
                <td><p>Mercury orbits the Sun at an average distance of 58 million kilometers, completing one orbit every 88 Earth days - the shortest year of any planet. Its highly elliptical orbit brings it as close as 46 million kilometers to the Sun and as far as 70 million kilometers away. Mercury is tidally locked in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance, meaning it rotates exactly three times for every two orbits around the Sun. This creates Mercury's unusual day-night cycle where one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) lasts 176 Earth days. From Mercury's surface, the Sun would appear about 2.5 times larger than from Earth and would sometimes appear to move backward in the sky due to orbital mechanics.</p></td>
